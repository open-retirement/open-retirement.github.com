              <p>Sometimes called elder orphans, seniors with no relatives available to help them manage aging and illness are a large and likely growing group, according to Dr. Maria Torroella Carney, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y. Roughly 22 percent of adults over the age of 65 are elder orphans or are at risk of becoming elder orphans because they don't have spouses, children, or siblings who live nearby, according to an analysis by Carney and three co-authors that was presented at the American Geriatrics Society's 2015 annual meeting.</p>

              <p>New nursing home ratings published on a Medicare-run consumer website don't answer questions about the system's accuracy, a Democratic senator told Bloomberg BNA Aug. 10. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services changed the overall five-star quality ratings on its Nursing Home Compare website by including data from another five quality measures, an Aug. 10 fact sheet said.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-ukrainian-priest-accused-met-20160821-story.html">Chicago Tribune: Chicago priest accused of taking $500,000 from parishioner with dementia</a></h3>
              <p>Standing before the religious icons that line his Ukrainian Orthodox church in Humboldt Park, the Rev. Nicholas Chervyatiuk has ministered to followers who arrived in Chicago as refugees after surviving Nazi Germany's prison camps. Now the Cook County public guardian is accusing the priest of improperly taking more than $500,000 from the savings of one of those displaced persons, a 93-year-old former church secretary diagnosed with dementia.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-sacred-heart-hospital-sentencing-met-20160812-story.html">Doctor sentenced to 2 years in nursing home bribery scheme</a></h3>
              <p>In the years before Sacred Heart Hospital abruptly closed, a series of elderly nursing home patients were taken to the struggling West Side medical facility, where they were whisked directly into a room to be examined and tested. The reasons for admission were murky. The trips to Sacred Heart, situated in the Garfield Park area, often made little geographic sense. Many of the patients were mentally disabled and poor.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-nursing-home-lawsuit-0621-biz-20160620-story.html">Nursing homes file suit to stop rival's expansion</a></h3>
              <p>Three nursing homes have gone to court to stop two projects that would bring new competition to the western suburbs. Community Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Naperville, The Springs at Monarch Landing in Naperville and Bria Health Services in Westmont filed two lawsuits last week challenging recent state approvals of proposals by a new rival, Transitional Care Management, to open facilities in Lisle and Aurora. The projects have been controversial in the nursing home industry because Transitional Care only wants to treat patients who were hospitalized but need short-term rehabilitative therapy before they go home.</p>

              <p>In essence, the bill allows older adults to remain at home and in the community by providing them with necessary services to maintain their independence. The Older Americans Act also saves Medicaid and Medicare untold millions each year.</p>

              <p>A "senior" version of "nanny cams" is about to hit Illinois nursing homes. As of Jan. 1 [2016], a new state law, the Authorized Electronic Monitoring in Long-Term Care Facilities Act allows video or audio recording devices to be placed in Illinois nursing home rooms to monitor treatment.</p>
